# Overview
This is a project built during Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity. 
The goal is to train a neural network against labeled movie comments and 
then try predict whether a movie comment is positive or negative.
You can find more details in the [notebook](https://github.com/CtheSky/sentiment-analysis/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb).

# Movie Comment Data Set
The data I'm using are movie comments from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/).
It has been preprocessed and stored in `reviews.txt` and `labels.txt`. For the same line in these two files,
reviews.txt contains the review and labels.txt contains corresponding label which is either positive or negative.
